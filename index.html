    <h1>A One Person Dev Team</h1>
   <p><em>(Not Really)</em></p>
    <h1> Description</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Microwaved Games is a development studio made by Microwaved Pie. We (or more like I) haven't actually released anything. The name is mostly just for fun and doesn't actually mean anything.</p>

    <p>Final Release Date: Early 2024 </p>
    <p>Description: </p>
    <p> First time I used a real programming language to make a game. This was more of an arcade styled game, focusing on gameplay rather then graphics and presentation like BFTG.</p>
